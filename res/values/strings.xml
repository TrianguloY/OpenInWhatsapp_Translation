<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><!--
strings.xml file from Click to chat app by TrianguloY.
Permission given to translate only.

Instructions for manual translation:
-Translate only the text between <string name="something"> TRANSLATE </string> and <item> TRANSLATE </item>
-Line breaks are specified with '\n' or using " " in the whole string, and special characters as quotes need to be preceded by backslash "\'" or using a special syntax like "&" -> "&amp;" (more information here: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/characters.html). If you have troubles with this just write things directly (like a txt) and I'll try to fix the syntax.
- Any '%1$s' or similar is a placeholder that will be replaced with another string. Keep it in their position.
- "[[tag|name]]" will be shown as a clickable link. Translate only the name, keep the tag unmodified.
